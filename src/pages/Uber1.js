              Let's start by making the searchbar/header for the app. Let's make sure we smoothly morph from the single searchbar hovering over the map into the double searchbar that sits above the search results.

              To get a really close look at the animation, you can download this video and try scrubbing through it frame-by-frame: <a href={'https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/24487100/uber-animation.mov'}>full res animation</a>. You can also look at the Uber app (although the animation is a bit different... and more clunky!).
            </div>
            <div style={{marginTop: 20, marginBottom: 20}}>
              <img
                height={200}
                src={'uber-step-header-animation.png'}

              Start by rendering <code>LocationSearchHeader</code> into the <code>Main</code> container. It will probably be easiest to think of the search header as having two states: expanded and collapsed. You can then use <code>react-native-animatable</code> and the <code>transition</code> prop to animate each element in the header between those two states.
            </div>
            <div style={styles.p}>
              In collapsed state, the elements are:
            </div>
            <ul>
              <li>White box in the background</li>
              <li>Black square</li>
              <li>"Where to?" text</li>
            </ul>
            <div style={styles.p}>
              In expanded state, the elements are:
            </div>
            <ul>
              <li>White box in the background, now much larger</li>
              <li>Black square</li>
              <li>Grey vertical bar</li>
              <li>Grey dot</li>
              <li>Light grey background with "Work" text</li>
              <li>Darker grey background with "Where to?" text</li>
            </ul>
            <div style={styles.p}>
              For elements which exist in the expanded state but not the collapsed state, try animating the opacity between 0 and 1 so they smoothly appear and disappear.
            </div>
            <div style={styles.p}>
              For simplicity, you don't need to make the search fields <i>actually work</i> yet (i.e. accept user input). Just use View and Text and get it looking correct.
            </div>
            <div style={styles.h3}>Hints</div>
            <div style={styles.p}>
              It's probably easiest to build the entire header (including both transition states) in just this one component file. You'll want to set the style of each element you render to <code>{`{position: 'absolute'}`}</code>, and render in terms of absolute positions using <code>{`{top, right, bottom, left'}`}</code>, rather than using flexbox.
            </div>
            <div style={styles.p}>
              You'll also want to use <code>zIndex</code> to make sure elements overlap in the correct way.
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </DefaultPage>
