Lists are like ScrollViews, but optimized to recycle elements and reduce re-renders for better performance. As a result, the APIs are a little more complicated than ScrollView. The built-in list components in React Native are still evolving, so you can expect more features and performance from these in the future.

FlatList and SectionList are the recommended list components for simple, performant lists. They're built on top of VirtualizedList, which is a highly flexible and optimized list implementation, which generally shouldn't be used directly. These replace the (now deprecated) ListView component.
