Instead of using \`var\` to declare local variables, we use \`const\` and \`let\`. The main difference is that \`var\` is scoped to a function, while \`const\` and \`let\` are scoped to a block.

Additionally, variables declared with \`const\` can only be assigned a value once. Assigning another value to the same name will throw a compiler error. Note that if the value assigned to a \`const\` variable is an object or array, the object or array may still be modified. In other words, it's only the variable name that is bound permanently -- the value itself is still mutable.

<EditorTranspiler
  code=${code}
  title=${'Using const and let'}
/>

You'll notice that the compiled output replaces \`const\` and \`let\` with \`var\`. You'll also notice that Babel transforms \`const a = 3\` into \`var _a = 3\`. This is so that your code can run on older platforms that don't support the new block-scoped variable declarations. It's the Babel compiler that enforces proper usage and block-scoping, rather than the runtime JavaScript engine.
