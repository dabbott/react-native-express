`FlatList`s are used for large quantities of scrollable content. They expose the underlying `ScrollView`, but add performance improvements: only rendering the content on screen (clipping offscreen content), and only updating rows that have changed. Like `ScrollView`s, they can scroll horizontally or vertically.

Instead of rendering their `children` prop, `FlatList`s render each item in their input `data` using the `renderItem` prop. The `renderItem` prop is a function which takes an item from the `data` array and maps it to a React Element. Each item in `data` should be an object with a unique id, so that React can determine when items are rearranged. The unique id is looked up as `item.key` by default, but you can specify another way to find/build a the id by passing a `keyExtractor` function prop.

# Basic Example

<WebPlayer {...example} />
