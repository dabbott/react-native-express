\`Networking\` in React Native is built on two APIs: \`fetch\` and \`XMLHttpRequest\`. Both of these were designed to be compatible with browser APIs so that:
- Web developers don't have to learn a new way to make network requests
- Libraries built on top of these function as expected in React Native

It's common to use the \`fetch\` API directly, since it's pretty simple and high-level. It's rare to use XMLHttpRequest directly, since it's complex and low-level. If your networking needs are advanced (multi-part form requests, etc), you'll likely want to use a library which abstracts the details of these networking APIs.

If you're looking for an abstraction layer, the common networking libraries like \`axios\` and \`superagent\` will still work in React Native.

# Fetch API

Let's take a look at \`fetch\`, since it's easy to use and comes with React Native out of the box. The Fetch API is promise-based, meaning we can use \`async/await\`.

## **\`const response = await fetch(uri)\`**

Send a \`GET\` request to \`uri\`, returning a promise which represents a \`Response\` object. To access the data returned, you must either await \`response.text()\` or \`response.json()\`.

## **\`const json = await response.json()\`**

Parse the body of the response asynchronously as JSON.

## **\`const text = await response.text()\`**

Get the body of the response as text.

## That's it!

We can get started using \`fetch\` with just that! If you want to use fetch with custom request headers or for \`POST\` requests, read more about the API [here at MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch).

# Example

Here we'll fetch a list of posts and display them in a ScrollView. Since \`fetch\` is asynchronous, our app may not have data when it loads. We should be prepared to show an \`ActivityIndicator\` (spinner) while data loads. We should also be prepared to show an error message if fetching data fails.

*Note: fetch only works in Chrome and Firefox at the moment, so this example won't run in Safari or IE.*
