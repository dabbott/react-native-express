import EditorConsole from '../../components/EditorConsole'
import properties from '../../examples/files/classes/properties.ts'

Properties can be configured in a variety of ways:

- Properties can have default values
- Private properties are prefixed with `#`
- Dynamically computed properties (getters) are defined as functions with the `get` keyword
- Static properties use the `static` keyword

<EditorConsole   
  title={"Properties"}
  code={properties}
/>

## Legacy private properties

Prior to `#` private property support, properties were made "private" by convention: private properties and methods were prefixed with `_`.
