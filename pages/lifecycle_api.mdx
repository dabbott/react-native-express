Components have a lifecycle: they are instantiated, mounted, rendered, and eventually updated, unmounted, and destroyed. The lifecycle helps manage the complexity of different platform APIs (iOS, Android) by providing a simple, consistent abstraction layer. The lifecycle also allows you to optionally execute custom code at each step for more fine-grained control of the rendering.

Let's look at each phase of the component lifecycle.

## Mounting Cycle

- `constructor(object props)`<br/>
  The component class is instantiated. The parameters to the constructor are the element's initial `props`, as specified by the parent element. You can optionally specify an initial state for the element by assigning an object to `this.state`. At this point, no native UI has been rendered yet for this element.

- `componentWillMount()`<br/>
  This method is invoked only once, before rendering occurs for the first time. At this point, there is still no native UI rendered for this element.

- `render() -> React Element`<br/>
  The render method must return a React Element to render (or null, to render nothing).

- `componentDidMount()`<br/>
  This method is invoked only once, after rendering occurs for the first time. At this point, the native UI for this element has finished rendering, and may be accessed through `this.refs` for direct manipulation. If you need to make async API calls or execute delayed code with `setTimeout`, that should generally be done in this method.

## Updating Cycle

- `componentWillReceiveProps(object nextProps)`<br/>
  The parent of this component has passed a new set of `props`. This component will re-render. You may optionally call `this.setState()` to update this component's internal state before the `render` method is called.

- `shouldComponentUpdate(object nextProps, object nextState) -> boolean`<br/>
  Based on the next values of `props` and `state`, a component may decide to re-render or not to re-render. The base class's implementation of this method always returns `true` (the component <i>should</i> re-render). For optimization, override this method and check if either `props` or `state` have been modified, e.g. run an equality test of each key/value in these objects. Returning `false` will prevent the `render` method from being called.

- `componentWillUpdate(object nextProps, object nextState)`<br/>
  This method is invoked, after the decision has been made to re-render. You may not call `this.setState()` here, since an update is already in progress.

- `render() -> React Element`<br/>
  This method is called, assuming `shouldComponentUpdate` returned `true`. The render method must return a React Element to render (or null, to render nothing).

- `componentDidUpdate(object prevProps, object prevState)`<br/>
  This method is invoked after re-rendering occurs. At this point, the native UI for this component has been updated to reflect the React Element returned from the `render()` method.
