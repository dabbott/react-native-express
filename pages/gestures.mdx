In React Native, gestures are created using the `PanResponder` API.

## **`PanResponder`**

Most built-in React Native components (`View`, `Text`, etc) can become a responder and handle touch events. You'll need to create a set of `panHandlers` and pass them into your component as props. Call `{'panResponder = PanResponder.create(panHandlers)'}` with an object containing handlers to create a `PanResponder`. You can then access `panResponder.panHandlers`, which will be an enhanced version of the handlers object you passed in.

## **`PanHandlers`**

You will likely want to handle `onStartShouldSetPanResponder` or `onMoveShouldSetPanResponder` to become a response and handle the gesture. Beyond that, you'll likely want to handle the `Grant`, `Move`, `Release`, and `Terminate` to update your UI in response to the gesture. Unless you have many complex gestures in your app, you generally won't need to include every handler to get a working gesture.

Here's the list of _all_ handlers:

- `onMoveShouldSetPanResponder: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
- `onMoveShouldSetPanResponderCapture: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
- `onStartShouldSetPanResponder: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
- `onStartShouldSetPanResponderCapture: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
- `onPanResponderReject: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
- `onPanResponderGrant: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
- `onPanResponderStart: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
- `onPanResponderEnd: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
- `onPanResponderRelease: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
- `onPanResponderMove: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
- `onPanResponderTerminate: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
- `onPanResponderTerminationRequest: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
- `onShouldBlockNativeResponder: (e, gestureState) => {...}`

More details are available on each of these in the [docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/panresponder.html).
