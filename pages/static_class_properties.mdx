import EditorConsole from '../components/EditorConsole'
import example from '../examples/static_class_properties'


As we saw in our ES2015 section, static functions on classes exist as a part of ES2015. In ES2016, we can use the `static` keyword to declare static properties as well. Static properties exist directly on the class.

<EditorConsole {...example} />
