# Hooks

Hooks are specially-implemented functions that let us add functionality to React components beyond just creating and returning React elements.

We'll look at the following hooks in more detail:

- `useState`
- `useReducer`
- `useEffect`
- `useRef`

We can also compose the built-in hooks to build our own.
