We can use the `async` keyword before a function name to wrap the return value of this function in a `Promise`. We can use the `await` keyword (in an `async` function) to wait for a promise to be resolved or rejected before continuing code execution in this block.

This syntax also propagates exceptions that occur in promises using a `try`/`catch` block, just as if the code were running synchronously.
