React Native Animatable is a library for declarative animations. See the Github repo [here](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-animatable).
Creating animations is much easier than with `Animated`. Like with `Animated`, we'll first need to use a specially wrapped component: `Animatable.View`, `Animatable.Text`, `Animatable.Image`, or `Animatable.createAnimatableComponent(Component)`. From there, we add an `animation` prop to our component to specify which kind of animation to use, e.g. `fadeIn`. We can control the parameters of the animation through props.

# Example

<WebPlayer {...example} />
