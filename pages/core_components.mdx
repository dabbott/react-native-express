# Core Components

React Native includes a few dozen components which can be used out-of-the-box. More complex components can be built by combining the core components in interesting ways.

Nearly all the core components extend the `View` component, and can be passed an optional `style` prop. The style can include visual properties like colors and borders, as well as layout properties. Components use the flexbox algorithm to specify the layout of their children.

Let's now take a look at the flexbox algorithm and some of the most common core components. If you want to dive deeper, I cover these topics in great detail in the "Core Components" chapter of my [book](https://www.fullstackreact.com/react-native/).
