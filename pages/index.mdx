# React Native Express

React Native is a JavaScript framework for building cross-platform apps.

Building with React Native is extremely efficient â€” but getting started can be a little tricky. You should use this guide as a companion to the official Facebook documentation for [getting started](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started.html). The Facebook guide assumes some existing knowledge about JavaScript and React development for the web. If you run into topics that aren't covered thoroughly, play with the examples in this guide to quickly get up to speed. If you're already knowledgeable about a topic in this guide (e.g. React hooks), feel free to skip it entirely.

I hope you enjoy learning React Native. Most of this guide was written by me, [@dvnabbott](https://twitter.com/dvnabbott). Some pages are written by other authors (listed at top of each page)

If you like this site, I recently wrote a digital book, [Fullstack React Native: The complete guide to React Native](https://gumroad.com/a/567063667). In the book, I cover the most important React Native topics in-depth as we build 7 full apps. Be sure to check it out!

## Hello World

A "Hello world" app for React Native looks something like this:

<Example code={example} />

If you haven't written JavaScript in a while, you may notice some unfamiliar things in the code. This is because it uses newer language features and the JSX language extension. We'll be touching on these after we set up our environment.

### Up next

Now, let's set up our React Native development environment!
