# React Native Express

React Native is a framework for building cross-platform apps.

Building with React Native is extremely efficient and highly addictive â€” but getting started can be a little tricky. You should use this guide as a companion to the official Facebook documentation for [getting started](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started.html). The Facebook guide assumes some existing knowledge about React development for the web. If you run into topics that aren't covered thoroughly, play with the examples in this guide to quickly get up to speed. This guide also covers related topics, such as Redux, which are beyond the scope of the React Native docs.

I hope you enjoy learning React Native. Most of this guide was written by me, [@dvnabbott](https://twitter.com/dvnabbott). Some pages are written by other authors (listed at top of each page)

If you like this site, I recently wrote a digital book, [Fullstack React Native: The complete guide to React Native](https://gumroad.com/a/567063667). In the book, I cover the most important React Native topics in-depth as we build 7 full apps. Be sure to check it out!

## Hello World

A "Hello world" app for React Native looks something like this:

<Example code={example} />

If you haven't written JavaScript in a while, you may notice some unfamiliar things in the code. This is because it uses newer language features (ES2015 imports, classes, block-scoped variable declarations) and the JSX language extension. In the following sections, I'll give a brief background on each of these topics. If you're already familiar with a topic, feel free to skip ahead. Most of the sections in this guide are independent from one another.

But first, let's set up our React Native development environment!
