# Classes

JavaScript supports object-oriented programming with classes. JavaScript classes support single inheritance, private properties/methods, and static (i.e. class) properties/methods. Classes don't support interfaces (i.e. protocols or type classes), so they may feel somewhat limited compared to other languages.

> TypeScript supports `interface` type declarations, but not default implementations.

> Many developers prefer programming without classes, instead using functional patterns and storing data in plain JavaScript objects.
