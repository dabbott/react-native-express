## Importing and exporting

We can use the keyword `import` to load values from other JavaScript files via relative path.

We use `export` to expose values for importing.

<Example
  width={0}
  height={300}
  files={{
    'index.js': defaultImport,
    'myNumber.js': `export default 42\n`,
  }}
/>

## Named imports and exports

A single file can have multiple exports, and any subset of these can be imported simultaneously.

<Example
  width={0}
  height={300}
  files={{
    'index.js': namedImports,
    'myValues.js': namedExports,
  }}
/>

## Importing from modules

There's a shorter syntax for importing 3rd party libraries: we import the name of the module's directory within `node_modules` (which is the name of the package in the `npm` package registry).

Libraries specify a "main" file in their `package.json`, usually named `index.js`, which is what actually gets imported. E.g. assuming we had downloaded the `moment` library into our `node_modules`, we could import `'./node_modules/moment/index.js'` with just `'moment'`.

> Note: importing the path to a directory will generally import the `index.js` file in that directory. Some developers prefer importing from `./myDirectory` rather than `./myDirectory/index.js`, but these are equivalent.

<Example
  title="Importing a library"
  width={0}
  height={300}
  code={momentExample}
  vendorComponents={[moment]}
/>
