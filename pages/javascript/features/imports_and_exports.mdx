# Imports and Exports

We can use the keyword `import` to load values from other JavaScript files via relative path.

We use `export` to expose values for importing.

<Example
  width={0}
  height={300}
  files={[
    ['index.js', defaultImport],
    ['myNumber.js', `export default 42\n`],
  ]}
/>

## Named imports and exports

A single file can have multiple exports, and any subset of these can be imported simultaneously.

<Example
  width={0}
  height={300}
  files={[
    ['index.js', namedImports],
    ['myValues.js', namedExports],
  ]}
/>

## Importing from modules

There's a shorter syntax for importing 3rd party libraries: we import the name of the module's directory within `node_modules` (which is the name of the package in the `npm` package registry).

Libraries specify a "main" file in their `package.json`, usually named `index.js`, which is what actually gets imported. E.g. assuming we had downloaded the `moment` library into our `node_modules`, we could import `'./node_modules/moment/index.js'` with just `'moment'`.

> Note: importing the _relative_ path to a directory will always import the `index.js` file in that directory, ignoring any "main" file specified.

<Example
  width={0}
  height={300}
  code={momentExample}
  vendorComponents={[moment]}
/>
