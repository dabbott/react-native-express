# Imports and Exports

We can use the keyword `import` to load values from other JavaScript files via relative path.

We use `export` to expose values for importing.

<Example {...importsAndExports} />

## Named imports and exports

A single file can have multiple exports, and any subset of these can be imported simultaneously.

<Example {...namedImportsAndExports} />

---

## Importing from modules

3rd party libraries specify a "main" file, usually named `index.js`.

There's a shorter syntax for importing this file: we import the name of the module's directory (which is the name of the package in the `npm` registry).

E.g. assuming we had downloaded the `moment` library into our `node_modules`:

> Similarly, importing a directory will import the `index.js` file in that directory.

<Example
  width={0}
  heigth={300}
  code={momentExample}
  vendorComponents={[moment]}
/>
