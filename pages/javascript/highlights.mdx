# JavaScript Highlights

The JavaScript language is updated yearly with new features. If you haven't used JavaScript in a while, you may see some new syntax in React Native code.

In this section, we'll cover a handful of new features from recent years which are common in React Native apps:

- Imports and exports
- Block-scoped declarations
- Arrow functions
- Classes
- Destructuring
- Spread
- Async/await
