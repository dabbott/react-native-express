# Gestures

We use gestures to support user interactions that are more complex than pressing a button, e.g. swiping, dragging, and pinching.

There are 2 common approaches:

- `PanResponder` - The built-in gesture API
- `react-native-gesture-hander` - A library that bridges built-in native gesture handling code

Let's look at each of these in more detail.
