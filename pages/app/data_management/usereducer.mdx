# Managing data with useReducer

We can use React's `useReducer` hook to manage our application data. In this example we'll look at a small To-Do list app that manages its data with `useReducer`.

Using the terminology from the [Project Structure](/app/project_structure) section, this app contains:

- A "container" component, `App`, that connects our application/business logic for adding and removing To-Do items with our UI components
- 3 "presentational" components that we use to display our UI: `List`, `Input`, and `Title`
- A `reducer` file that contains the initial state of our app and a reducer function for updating the state

<Example
  height={900}
  files={[
    ['App.js', App],
    ['List.js', List],
    ['Input.js', Input],
    ['Title.js', Title],
    ['reducer.js', reducer],
  ]}
/>
