# Navigation

- [react-navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/)
- Everything is a React Component
  - Doesn’t map 1:1 to native paradigms
  - Some React Components don’t map to Views at all
- Fundamentally different on web vs. mobile
  - On web, navigation is mostly stateless, 1 route === 1 screen/page
  - On mobile, navigation is stateful (e.g. a stack can even contain the same screen twice)
