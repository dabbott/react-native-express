# AsyncStorage

`AsyncStorage` is a built-in React Native API for client-side data persistence. Here we'll cover basic usage of the API; as your data gets complex, you will likely want to use a library built on top of `AsyncStorage`, such as Redux Persist.

## API

The AsyncStorage API is promise-based. All getting and setting of key-value pairs is asynchronous. Thanks to the new `async/await`, interacting with the API isn't much more difficult than if it were synchronous.

### **`await getItem(key) => ?string`**

Get the `value` stored at `key`. This will return a string, or null if no data has been stored yet for that `key`. Don't forget to call `JSON.parse(value)` if you're storing your data in JSON format.

### **`await setItem(key, value)`**

Store `value` at `key`. Don't forget to call `JSON.stringify(value)` if you're storing your data in JSON format.

### **`await clear()`**

Clear all stored data.

### That's it!

These three APIs are frequently all you'll need. There are a few more APIs worth being aware of, in case you end up using AsyncStorage for more complex things:

- `removeItem(key)`
- `mergeItem(key, value)`
- `getAllKeys() => Array(string)`
- `flushGetRequests()`
- `multiGet(keys) => Array(Array(string))`
- `multiSet(keyValuePairs)`
- `multiRemove(keys)`
- `multiMerge(keyValuePairs)`

Don't forget, all of these functions (including `getItem` and `setItem`) can throw errors upon failure which you'll want to handle!

## Example

Let's look at an example of getting and setting a key-value pair in `AsyncStorage`.

### Files

- `index.js`<br />
  The `App` component loads the value at `STORAGE_KEY` into `this.state` when it mounts. Every time you type your name in the input field and hit enter, we save `name` to `STORAGE_KEY`, as well as updating the value in `this.state`. Note that we also catch errors thrown when loading/saving, which is simple thanks to `async/await`.

- `Input.js`<br />
  Presentational component
