# Navigating and Routes

Each navigator supports different ways of navigating:

- Stack: `push`
- Tabs: `navigate`
- Drawer: `openDrawer`

When navigating, we typically specify a screen name and optionally parameters, e.g. `navigator.push("Screen2", { paramA: "Hello!" })`.

Let's look at how this might work.

---

## Navigation

In this example, we navigate from `Screen1` to `Screen2` by pushing `Screen2` onto the stack when a button is pressed.

<Example
  height={300}
  files={{
    JavaScript: pushJs,
    TypeScript: pushTsx,
  }}
  panes={['editor']}
/>

---

## Routes

Within a screen, we have access to the current route and its parameters.

<Example
  height={300}
  files={{
    JavaScript: routeJs,
    TypeScript: routeTsx,
  }}
  panes={['editor']}
/>

---

## Hooks

For components which aren't screens (direct descendants of a navigator), we can access the `navigation` and `route` objects using hooks.

> Some developers prefer using these hooks instead of props, even in screen components.

<Example
  height={300}
  files={{
    JavaScript: hooksJs,
    TypeScript: hooksTsx,
  }}
  panes={['editor']}
/>
