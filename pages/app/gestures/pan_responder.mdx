# Pan Responder

Most React Native components, like `View`, can handle touch/click events. However, the APIs for doing this are fairly low level, so we rarely use them directly. Instead, we use the `PanResponder` API, which is a higher level abstraction for handling touch/click events.

## API

Only a single component can respond to touch events at one time - the component responding to events owns a global "interaction lock". The `PanResponder` API helps us manage what component owns this lock through a set of callbacks. Each of these callbacks is also passed an `event` and `gestureState` object containing info about the touch events (e.g. position and velocity).

To create a `PanResponder`, we call `PanResponder.create(callbacksObject)`. The result is a set of props that can be passed to `View` as props (these are the lower-level touch event handling props). We'll typically wrap the result with `useRef`, since we only want to create a single `PanResponder` for the lifecycle of the component.

The full set of callbacks we can pass is:

- `onStartShouldSetPanResponder: (event, gestureState) => {}`
- `onStartShouldSetPanResponderCapture: (event, gestureState) => {}`
- `onMoveShouldSetPanResponder: (event, gestureState) => {}`
- `onMoveShouldSetPanResponderCapture: (event, gestureState) => {}`
- `onPanResponderReject: (event, gestureState) => {}`
- `onPanResponderGrant: (event, gestureState) => {}`
- `onPanResponderStart: (event, gestureState) => {}`
- `onPanResponderEnd: (event, gestureState) => {}`
- `onPanResponderRelease: (event, gestureState) => {}`
- `onPanResponderMove: (event, gestureState) => {}`
- `onPanResponderTerminate: (event, gestureState) => {}`
- `onPanResponderTerminationRequest: (event, gestureState) => {}`
- `onShouldBlockNativeResponder: (event, gestureState) => {}`

## Example

In this example, we'll use `PanResponder` to create a drag interaction. There are 3 parts:

- `pan.js` - This contains a reducer function for managing the state of the drag (we use the conventions from the [managing data with useReducer](/app/data_management/usereducer) section)
- `usePanResponder.js` - A custom hook that creates a `PanResponder` with a set of callbacks for managing the gesture and updating the state of the drag via `useReducer`.
- `App.js` - We call our custom `usePanResponder` hook, passing the created panHandlers into a `View`, and using the drag state to update the style.

> In a real app, we should generally use `Animated.Value`s in our style for better performance. E.g. create a `positionY` animated value from `initialY` and `offsetY`, and start a fast `.timing` animation whenever the state of the drag changes.
