# Animation

There are 3 common approaches to animation in React Native:

- `Animated` - a built-in API for animating component styles
- `LayoutAnimation` - a built-in API for animating between 2 component hierarchies (think "magic move"), although still considered experimental
- `react-native-reanimated` - "worklets" that run in a second JS context on the UI thread

Most animations will use `Animated`.
