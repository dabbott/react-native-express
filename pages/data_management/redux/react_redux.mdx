# React Redux

Redux has official bindings for React in a package called [React Redux](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/UsageWithReact.html).

In the previous examples, we imported the `store` object directly in our container component's file. We then started listening to changes in `componentWillMount` with `store.subscribe()`, and we made sure to unsubscribe in `componentWillUnmount`. We dispatched actions with `store.dispatch(action)`.

There are a few issues with using Redux this way:

- Subscribing and unsubscribing to the store in our components is tedious and error-prone.
- Every container component will re-render on _every_ change to the store, potentially becoming a performance issue.
- Using the store directly exposes the entire store API to our components; generally, components only need to be aware of the `dispatch()` API.

React Redux addresses these issues.

## React Redux API

## `Provider`

React Redux exposes the `Provider` component to handle passing our store to every container component. We'll generally use this to wrap the root component of our app, e.g. `<Provider store={store}> ... </Provider>`.

## `connect(mapStateToProps)(Component) => Component`

We use `connect()` to access the state of our `store` in our container components. Call `connect(mapStateToProps)` with a function that takes the state of the store, mapping it to `props` to be passed into our container component, `(state) => props`. Calling `connect()` returns <b>another function</b>, which we should then call with our container component, `connect(...)(Component)`, to get a "connected" component. This connected component will automatically have a `dispatch` prop (for dispatching actions), and the result of `mapStateToProps` will be merged into the component's props.

### That's enough to get started!

There are more APIs, and more parameters to the `connect()` function, but these are the ones you need to get going. Feel free to read more about React Redux in the [docs](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/UsageWithReact.html).

## To-Do List Example

Let's take a look at our To-Do List app again, now that it's using React Redux.

### Files

- `index.js`<br />
  This file handles creating the redux store and passing it to our `Provider`. The `Provider` will let us connect our `App` container to the store with `connect()`.

- `todoListRedux.js`<br />
  The same as in the Redux example.

- `App.js`<br />
  `App` is connected to the store using `connect()`. It pulls the list data, `todos`, out of the store's state using `mapStateToProps`. It uses the `dispatch()` function added to its props to dispatch actions to modify the store.

- `List.js`, `Input.js`, `Title.js`<br />
  Presentational components - these are the same as in the Component State example.
