# Photo Gallery

In this exercise, we'll render a grid of photos from [Picsum Photos](https://picsum.photos) in an infinitely-scrolling `FlatList`.

<Example
  prelude={`ReactNative.Dimensions._update()`}
  panes={['player']}
  height={540}
  files={[
    ['App.js', require('../../examples/files/exercises/PhotoGallery').default],
    [
      'components/PhotoGrid.js',
      require('../../examples/files/exercises/PhotoGrid').default,
    ],
    [
      'reducers/photos.js',
      require('../../examples/files/exercises/photos').default,
    ],
    ['api/picsum.js', require('../../examples/files/exercises/picsum').default],
  ]}
/>

## Project set up

Start by initializing a new project. You can use either approach described in the [Environment](/environment) section. If you're using Expo (recommended for beginners), run:

```bash
expo init PhotoGallery
```

## Project Structure

In this app, we'll follow the suggested structure from the [Project Structure](/app/project_structure) section, and divide our files into 3 directories:

- `api` - for fetching remote data
- `components` - presentational components
- `reducers` - for managing app data with `useReducer`

The final directory structure will look like this:

<FileTreeDiagram>
  {() => ({
    name: 'PhotoGallery',
    children: [
      {
        name: 'api',
        children: ['picsum.js'],
      },
      {
        name: 'components',
        children: ['PhotoGrid.js'],
      },
      {
        name: 'reducers',
        children: ['photos.js'],
      },
      'App.js',
    ],
  })}
</FileTreeDiagram>

## Walkthrough

Here's a step-by-step walkthrough to build this app.

## Possible improvements

If you'd like to continue further with this exercise, here are a few ideas:

- Use the `PixelRatio` API to detect the pixel density of the device (e.g. `3`), and fetch higher resolution images if needed.
- Persist the fetched images across app launches with [AsyncStorage](/app/persistence/asyncstorage)
- Use [`react-navigation`](/app/navigation/react_navigation) to add a "details" screen that appears when tapping a photo - there's more
