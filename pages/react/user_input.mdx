# User Input

In React, most input components are stateless. An input component typically has a `value` prop and a prop prefixed with `onChange`, and together these things give us complete control over the input without ever having to access the native UI imperatively.

## Input field

Here's an example of a text input field.

We introduce a **state variable**, `text`, to store the current value of the input field. We pass `text` into the `TextInput` as the `value` prop, and any time `onChangeText` is called, we update call `setText` to update our state variable.

> We use the [useState](/react/hooks/usestate) hook to store the text value. We'll cover this soon.
