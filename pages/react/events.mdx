# Events

Some components trigger events/callbacks in response to user input. To add an event handler, pass a function as a prop to a React element:

<Example
  code={nativeEvent}
  console={{
    enabled: true,
    visible: true,
  }}
  playground={{ enabled: false }}
/>

---

## Custom Events

Suppose we want to make a custom `CounterButton` component with an `onIncrement` callback. <Details>We can pass this prop into the `onPress` of a Button.</Details>

<Example code={customEvent} />
