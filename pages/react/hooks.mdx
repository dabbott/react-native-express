# Hooks

Hooks are specially-implemented functions that let us add functionality to React components beyond just creating and returning React elements.

We'll look at the following hooks in more detail:

- `useState`
- `useReducer`
- `useEffect`
- `useRef`

We can also compose built-in hooks to build our own.

## Rules and Linting

Hooks aren't regular functions; they have to be written in a certain way. To dive deeper into this topic, check out [Rules of Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html).

When using hooks, we typically want to use [`eslint`](https://eslint.org/) and the `react-hooks` plugin. Hooks are powerful, but can be unintuitive at first, and this tool catches _a lot_ of mistakes before we ever run our code. The Rules of Hooks link has more detail on how to install this.
