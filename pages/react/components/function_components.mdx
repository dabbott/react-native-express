# Function Components

A function component is a function that returns a React element.

<Example code={functionComponent} />

---

## Composing Components

We can use custom components like `MyComponent` in the same way as built-in ones like `View`. We use props to communicate between components.

<Example code={composingComponents} />

---

## TypeScript Types

We typically create a `Props` type.

> We typically don't set the type of the return value, since it can generally be inferred and doesn't provide much useful type safety.

<Example code={typescriptTypes} />

## Component Behaviors

We use **hooks** to add functionality to function components. Hooks are specially implemented functions that typically start with the prefix `use`.

> React provides ~10 built-in hooks, but we can also build our own. We'll talk much more about hooks later.

<Example code={componentBehaviors} />
