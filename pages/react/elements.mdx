# Elements

We instantiate **React elements** using the `React.createElement` API.<Details> Typically, we call this API using JSX elements, but it's also possible to call it directly.</Details>

The function signature is: `createElement(type, props, children)`.

## Element tree

Let's take a quick peek at the internals of a React element tree. <Details>The exact
details of the element tree aren't important to understand right now, but it's
useful to get the _gist_ of how React works.</Details>

In this example, we instantiate a few React components using JSX and then print their value to the console.

> If you click the line of text in the console on the right, you can navigate the tree of JavaScript objects.

<Example
  code={reactElements}
  sharedEnvironment={true}
  console={{
    enabled: true,
    visible: true,
    maximized: true,
    collapsible: false,
    renderReactElements: false,
  }}
  playground={{ enabled: false }}
  styles={{
    playerPane: {
      width: '50%',
    },
  }}
/>

## Element internals

A React element is a JavaScript object containing at least a `type` and `props`.

- The `type` is a function representing what UI element to render.
- The `props` object may contain arbitrary properties, e.g. `foo`, plus a `children` property containing nested React elements.<Details> The `children` property is somewhat special, since it's created automatically from the nested JSX elements in our code.</Details>

The `ref` and `key` aren't props... we'll come back to those.
