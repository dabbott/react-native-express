# useReducer

The `useReducer` hook is similar to `useState`, but gives us a more structured approach for updating complex values.

In this example, store both a `first` and `last` name in a single state object with `useReducer`.

> There are certain patterns/naming conventions we often use around reducers, which we'll discuss in more detail in [`useReducer` for managing data](/app/data_management/usereducer).
