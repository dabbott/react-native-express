# useState

The `useState` hook lets us "remember" a value within a component function. Since our component function may be called many times throughout the lifecycle of the component, any variable we declare normally (i.e. with `let myVar = ...`) will get reset. With `useState`, React can remember a **state variable** for us, making sure it gets passed into our component instance correctly.

## API

`useState` takes in an initial state as an argument and returns an array containing two elements: the current state, and a function which we can call to set a new state value.

> Notice, in the code when we call `setDiceRoll`, we are not pushing the integer returned from `randomDiceRoll()` into the `diceRolls` array. Instead, we are returning a new array that contains the destructured `diceRolls` array and the newly randomized dice roll.
