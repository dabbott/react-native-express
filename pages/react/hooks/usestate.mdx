# useState

> Notice, in the code when we call `setDiceRoll`, we are not pushing the integer returned from `randomDiceRoll()` into the `diceRolls` array. Instead, we are returning a new array that contains the destructured `diceRolls` array and the newly randomized dice roll.

<Example code={useStateArray} />
