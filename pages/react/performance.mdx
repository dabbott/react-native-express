# Performance

React is built for performance; React is used to build massively complex interfaces with thousands of elements, each one potentially responding to user interaction.

Because performance is so fundamental to React, it can be helpful to understand the performance model of various operations at a high level.

## Performance model

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Operation <div style={{ width: '260px' }} /> | Cost <div style={{ width: '100px' }} /> | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Native UI manipulation | Slow | React attempts to modify the native UI as _little_ as possible. |
| Component render | Fast | It's common for component functions to be called many times as the `props` of a component change. We often call this **rendering**. Components can re-render very frequently without a noticeable performance impact. |
| Comparing props | Very fast | In cases where a component is rendering too frequently and causing performance issues, we can limit the amount of re-renders by only re-rendering when props actually change. (See [`memo`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactmemo)) |
