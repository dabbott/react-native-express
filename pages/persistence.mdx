Client-side data persistence is often crucial to a great mobile experience: remembering a user's preferences and credentials, and showing data immediately when the app starts, instead of showing a spinner while fetching data remotely.

Generally, there are two ways to persist data on the client:

- The built-in `AsyncStorage` API, or libraries wrapping it
- A SQLite / native database wrapper

# Common Options for Client-side Persistence

| **AsyncStorage**  | `AsyncStorage` is a simple, low-level API for a key-value store. You can easily store and retrieve key-value pairs.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Redux Persist** | [Redux Persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist) is a library for automatically persisting the state of your Redux store to `AsyncStorage` on store changes, and rehydrating the store with this saved state when the app launches.                                                     |
| **Realm**         | The [Realm](https://realm.io/docs/react-native/latest/) library uses a custom database, written from scratch in C to be compatible on both iOS and Android. We covered Realm separately under Data Management, but if you're using Realm for managing your data, you get persistence for free! |

Let's look at a few examples using `AsyncStorage` and Redux Persist.
