Lists are like ScrollViews, but optimized to recycle elements and reduce re-renders for better performance. As a result, the APIs are a little more complex than `ScrollView`.

`FlatList` and `SectionList` are the recommended list components for performant lists. They're built on top of `VirtualizedList`, which is a highly flexible and optimized list implementation, that generally shouldn't be used directly. These replace the (now deprecated) `ListView` component.
