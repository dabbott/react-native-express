# Touchables

In React Native, most "buttons" are actually implemented using **Touchable** components.

Like `Button`, these components support an `onPress` prop. However, unlike `Button`, these components support custom styling - essentially a Touchable is a `View` that can be pressed.

Touchables have a variety of other props, like `onPressIn` and `onPressOut`, which give us more control over the behavior of the button. We can use these props to run custom animations. We'll cover custom animations later in the [animation section](/app/animation).

## Kinds of Touchable

Although we can run custom animations, most of the time, we use one of 2 built-in animations: a fade in opacity, or a change of color. There are preconfigured touchable components for each of these: `TouchableOpacity` and `TouchableHighlight`.

If we do want to write a custom animation, we'll typically use `TouchableWithoutFeedback`, since it doesn't have any built-in animation. If we want to support the native Android "ripple" effect, we'll use `TouchableNativeFeedback`.
