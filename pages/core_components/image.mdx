# Image

`Image` is used to render images. Images may either be downloaded from the web, or imported as files, which are then bundled with the app.

To bundle an image in the app, `import` the image file by its path, including the file extension. When loading bundled images, the same images are used to render on both iOS and Android. Writing `import './test.png'` will choose the most appropriate image for the device size: `test.png`, `test@2x.png`, or `test@3x.png`.

Layout works differently for images downloaded from the web and those imported as files.

- **Imported images**: the image file is scanned at build-time, and the image's dimensions are included as metadata in the app bundle. The dimensions of an `Image` component are then set to image's dimensions by default.
- **Images from the web**: the dimensions of the image aren't known at build-time, so the width and height of the `Image` are set to 0 by default. In order for the image to show up on the screen, we need to either set the width and height or a `flex` value in the `style` of the `Image`. If the dimensions _are_ known ahead-of-time, then they may be passed in the `source` prop along with the `uri`.
