import button from '../../examples/files/core_components/button.js'

We use the `Button` component when we want to show a button using the default/standard style for each native platform.

`Button` is convenient, but not very configurable, so if we want to customize the style beyond the color, we'll typically use `Touchable` components instead.

<Example code={button} />
