import touchableOpacity from '../../../examples/files/core_components/touchableOpacity.js'

This component fades out when pressed, and fades back in when released. We can style it however we want, just like a `View`.

We can configure the pressed opacity with the `activeOpacity` prop.

> This is typically the most common kind of button in a React Native app.

<Example code={touchableOpacity} />
