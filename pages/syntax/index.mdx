import EditorConsole from '../../components/EditorConsole'

JavaScript has most of the features you'd expect from a general purpose high-level programming language:

- Variables & constants
- Comparison, logical, math, and bitwise operators
- For loops, while loops, break, continue
- If statements, switch statements
- Functions & lambdas
- Type annotations (when TypeScript is enabled)

The syntax is generally similar to the C family of languages, so if you're not sure what to do, add parentheses around expressions and curly braces around blocks!

<EditorConsole   
  title={"Example"}
  panes={['editor']}
  playground={{ enabled: false }}
  code={`if (myValue > anotherValue) {
  doSomething()
}`}
/>
