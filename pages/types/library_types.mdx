There are _many_ other types in the standard library. Let's take a look at a few common ones.

> JavaScript runtime environments include additional types. E.g. Chrome, Node, and React Native all include their own additional types beyond what the standard library provides.

## Dates

We can use the `Date` class for interacting with dates.

<EditorConsole   
  title={"Dates"}
  code={dateType}
/>

## Regular Expressions

We can use the `RegExp` class for interacting with regular expressions.

<EditorConsole   
  title={"Regular Expressions"}
  code={regExpType}
/>
