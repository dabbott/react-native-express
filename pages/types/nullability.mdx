JavaScript has two different values used to represent "nothing": `null` and `undefined`.

## Undefined

The value `undefined` roughly means "this value doesn't exist". Here are a few common places where you'll see it: 

- It's the value of a variable before it gets assigned a value
- It's the return value of a function without a return statement
- It's the value when accessing an object with an unknown key

<EditorConsole   
  title={"Undefined"}
  code={undefinedType}
/>

## Null

The value `null` is used for _intentional_ non-existence: "this value exists, and it represents nothing". Conceptually, it's similar to the empty string for strings, or 0 for numbers.

<EditorConsole   
  title={"Null"}
  code={nullType}
/>
