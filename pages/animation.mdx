# Animation

React Native provides two animation APIs out of the box: `Animated` and `LayoutAnimation`. `Animated` is used far more frequently, so we'll only cover that here. If you're curious about `LayoutAnimation`, you can read more in the [docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/animations.html#layoutanimation).

`Animated` is a somewhat imperative API, meaning that you'll manually specify when to start and stop animations. This gives you a lot of control, but can get tedious quickly. Consider using [React Native Animatable](react_native_animatable) for a component-based declarative API around `Animated`.

If you're planning on building a rich, interactive UI, you'll also need the `PanResponder` API for tracking and responding to touch events.

Let's take a look at how these APIs work. If you want more hands-on practice with these APIs, we build a complete puzzle game in the "Animation" and "Gestures" chapters of my [book](https://gumroad.com/a/567063667).
