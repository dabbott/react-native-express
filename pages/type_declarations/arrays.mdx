import tuples from '../../examples/files/type_declarations/tuples.ts'

Arrays are a generic type that takes 1 type argument: the type of the element.

<EditorConsole   
  title={"Arrays"}
  code={arrays}
/>

## Tuples

JavaScript doesn't have a tuple type. Instead, we often use mixed arrays with a specific number of elements. TypeScript has a syntax to describe this.

<EditorConsole   
  title={"Tuples"}
  code={tuples}
/>
