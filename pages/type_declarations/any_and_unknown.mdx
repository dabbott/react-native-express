The types `any` and `unknown` are used when we don't know the type of a value (e.g. dynamic content like parsed json).

## Any

The type `any` essentially disables type-checking for a value. A variable with type `any` can be assigned any value, passed to any function, and called with any arguments, etc.

<EditorConsole   
  title={"Any"}
  code={any}
/>

## Unknown

The type `unknown` is the type-safe version of `any`. A variable with type `unknown` can't be used for anything without first refining it to another type.

Many standard library functions use `any`, but we should almost use `unknown` instead. Unknown is relatively new - otherwise more standard library functions would probably use it.

<EditorConsole   
  title={"Unknown"}
  code={unknown}
/>
